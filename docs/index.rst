In this article, we’ll use phrases like download Microsoft 365 already purchased, install Microsoft 365 already purchased, and reinstall Microsoft 365 already purchased so you know you’re reading the exact guide meant for your situation.

Step 1: Sign In to Your Microsoft Account
------------------------------------------

To begin, head to the official Microsoft 365 setup site:

`https://account.microsoft.com/services <https://account.microsoft.com/services>`_

- Use the Microsoft account that you used when you purchased Office or Microsoft 365.
- Once signed in, look for the Microsoft 365 product listed under Subscriptions.
- If you don’t see your product, ensure you're logging in with the same email used at purchase.

This step is essential for verifying your existing license and gives access to the install or download button.

Step 2: Download Microsoft 365 Already Purchased
-------------------------------------------------

After signing in:

1. Click the Install Office button next to your subscription.
2. Choose PC or Mac, depending on your system.
3. Select Download. This will start downloading the installer setup for Microsoft 365 or Office 2024.

Downloading from your Microsoft account ensures you’re getting the most updated and secure version available.

Step 3: Install Microsoft 365 Already Purchased
-----------------------------------------------

Once the file is downloaded:

- On Windows: Open the `.exe` file and allow it to make changes. The installer will run automatically and install Office apps like Word, Excel, and Outlook.
- On Mac: Open the `.pkg` file and follow the prompts. Enter your Mac admin password when asked.

When installation completes, open any Office app. You’ll be prompted to sign in again with your Microsoft account—this will activate your subscription.

Step 4: Reinstall Microsoft 365 Already Purchased
--------------------------------------------------

Need to reinstall Microsoft 365 already purchased because you reformatted your computer or moved to a new device? Here's what to do:

- Uninstall your existing Office installation from the old device
- Follow Step 1 to Step 3 on the new device
- Microsoft allows a set number of device installs—if you've hit the limit, go to your Microsoft account and deactivate Office on an old device to free up a slot

Step 5: Install Office 2024 Instead of Microsoft 365 (One-time Purchase)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you purchased a one-time license for Office 2024, the steps are slightly different:

- Go to: `https://setup.office.com <https://setup.office.com>`_
- Enter your product key from your retail card or email confirmation
- Sign in with or create a Microsoft account
- Download and install the software following on-screen instructions

The installation process is nearly identical, but activation is tied to the license key rather than a recurring subscription.

Troubleshooting Installation Issues
------------------------------------

If you face issues during the process:

Problem: Installer won’t launch  
Fix: Run the setup file as administrator (right-click > Run as Administrator)

Problem: Product key not recognized  
Fix: Double-check you’re using the correct Microsoft account. For Office 2024, make sure the product hasn’t already been used.

Problem: Activation fails  
Fix: Ensure you are connected to the internet and logged into the correct Microsoft account
